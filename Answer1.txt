HTML5 Features:

1. Video and Audio Features:
HTML5 has two crucial additions: audio and video tags. It enables web developers to include a video or audio file on their pages. 

2. Header and Footer:
These new tags eliminate the requirement for a div> tag to separate the two parts. The footer appears at the bottom of the page, whereas the header appears at the top.

3. Placeholders 
To make placeholders for text boxes before, we had to use a little JavaScript

4. Canvas:
A canvas is a rectangular area that may be used to conduct pixel-level operations such as drawing a line, box, circle, or executing graphics, among other things
